The Odin Project - Creating an entire web page from a design provided

So as it sounds in the title, this project is an assignment from The Odin Project to create an entire web page, using a design provided by The Odin Project, demonstrating skills learned up unto this point, including git commands on the command line, creating a repository on GitHub and cloning that repository to a local machine...again using the command line to navigate/create directories in our repo, creating our files for the web page (html, css, README) and opening and coding them using VS Code Editor. I will practice git commands to stage and commit modified files frequently, and use good habits to submit commit messages. That's all for now I've got to run, but will be sure to add to this README as I move along in the project!
